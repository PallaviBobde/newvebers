            Happy Rose Day!

            I wanted to send you this letter to let you know how much you mean
            to me. You bring so much happiness and love into my life, just like
            a beautiful rose brightens up a room.
            <br /> <br />
            Your kindness and support have made a big difference in my life, and
            I am grateful for you every day. So, on this special day, I want to
            say thank you for being amazing.
            <br /> <br />
            Please accept this virtual rose as a token of my affection for you.
            I hope it brings a smile to your face and reminds you of how much
            you are loved.
            <br /> <br />
            With love,
            <br />
            From - {firstName}
